# CC_Jackfruit_Non_Teaching_Campus_Management
The Campus Management System is a full-stack application designed to streamline operations for canteen and hostel services. Built on Python 3.8+ and Flask, it integrates MySQL for canteen management and SQLite for hostel functionalities. The frontend leverages HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.3, JavaScript, and Jinja2 templating for responsive and user-friendly interfaces. Key libraries include Flask-MySQLdb, MySQL Connector/Python, ConfigParser, Werkzeug, Matplotlib, and Pandas for data handling and visualization. Docker and Docker Compose are used for containerization and deployment, while Git and Pip manage version control and dependencies.

The system architecture consists of two independent Flask microservices: the canteen service running on port 5000 and the hostel service on port 5001. The canteen module handles contractor and staff management, order processing, inventory tracking, menu configuration, and feedback systems, with visual analytics powered by Matplotlib and Pandas. The hostel module focuses on weekly menu planning and meal time management using a lightweight SQLite database. Installation involves setting up MySQL, configuring connection details via a config.ini file, and launching services using Docker Compose. Developers can run each service individually or together, access them locally, and interact via defined API endpoints.
